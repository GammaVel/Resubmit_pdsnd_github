### Project Title
RESUBMIT - Git assignment  - Exploring Bikeshare data from America for 3 major cities

### Description
Analysis of Bikeshare data for Chicago, Washington and New York City, based off 2017 data (Jan-June), using Python with Pandas.
This is an interactive python program which runs via a console and asks the user for input to determine filters.
The program will display statistics depending on the filter the user has selected.
This includes the number of trips, the most popular time for cycling, trip information (duration), popular start and end locations and average and median age.
Note - there is no Date of Birth information available for Washington.

### Files used
There are three csv files with raw data for each city (chicago.csv, washington.csv and new_york_city.csv).
The csv files need to be saved to the same location as this Python script for it to run.
